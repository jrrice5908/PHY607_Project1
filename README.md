# PHY607_Project1

In this repository I have created five separate python files, two for the methods applied to an RC circuit and three for the methods applied to a volume charge distribution. 

To use this repo, navigate to the directory where you want to clone it:

```
cd /path/you/want/repo 
```

then clone the repo and cd into it:

```
 /git clone git@github.com:jrrice5908/PHY607_Project1.git # with ssh
```

```
 cd PHY607_Project1
```

To get the file output, run the corresponding python command:

```
$: python RCcircuit_EulerMethod.py
$: python RCcircuit_4thRungeKutta.py
$: python RiemannSum.py
$: python Simpsonsum.py
$: python TrapSum.py
```
